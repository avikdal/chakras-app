### Review of What I learned

Throughout this project, I had so much fun practicing the things I have been learning in React over the past couple of weeks. I was reminded that I have a lot of room to grow, specifically, I'm excited to continue practicing my CSS skills and building further on this project to continue to get better at working with React. Overall, I'm really pleased with what I built in the time I had and I look forward to improving this project.
